  abstract = "Abstract The Integrated Transport and Health Impact Model (ITHIM) is a comprehensive tool that estimates the hypothetical health effects of transportation mode shifts through changes to physical activity, air pollution, and injuries. The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation of \{ITHIM\} in greater Nashville, Tennessee (USA), describe important lessons learned, and serve as an implementation guide for other practitioners and researchers interested in running ITHIM. As might be expected in other metropolitan areas in the US, not all the required calibration data was available locally. We utilized data from local, state, and federal sources to fulfill the 14 \{ITHIM\} calibration items, which include disease burdens, travel habits, physical activity participation, air pollution levels, and traffic injuries and fatalities. Three scenarios were developed that modeled stepwise increases in walking and bicycling, and one that modeled reductions in car travel. Cost savings estimates were calculated by scaling national-level, disease-specific direct treatment costs and indirect lost productivity costs to the greater Nashville population of approximately 1.5 million. Implementation required approximately one year of intermittent, part-time work. Across the range of scenarios, results suggested that 24–123 deaths per year could be averted in the region through a 1–5\% reduction in the burden of several chronic diseases. This translated into $10–$63 million in estimated direct and indirect cost savings per year. Implementing \{ITHIM\} in greater Nashville has provided local decision makers with important information on the potential health effects of transportation choices. Other jurisdictions interested in \{ITHIM\} might find the Nashville example as a useful guide to streamline the effort required to calibrate and run the model. "

                  the evidence for an association between physical
                  activity of moderate intensity and risk of type 2
                  diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS{\textemdash}We
                  searched EMBASE and Medline through March 2006 and
                  examined reference lists of retrieved articles. We
                  excluded studies that did not assess physical
                  activity of moderate intensity independent of
                  activities of vigorous intensity (more than six
                  times the resting metabolic rate). Information on
                  study design, participant characteristics,
                  assessment of physical activity, and outcomes and
                  estimates of associations were extracted
                  independently by two investigators. We calculated
                  summary relative risks (RRs) using a random-effects
                  model for the highest versus the lowest reported
                  duration of activities. RESULTS{\textemdash}We
                  identified 10 prospective cohort studies of physical
                  activity of moderate intensity and type 2 diabetes,
                  including a total of 301,221 participants and 9,367
                  incident cases. Five of these studies specifically
                  investigated the role of walking. The summary RR of
                  type 2 diabetes was 0.69 (95\% CI
                  0.58{\textendash}0.83) for regular participation in
                  physical activity of moderate intensity as compared
                  with being sedentary. Similarly, the RR was 0.70
                  (0.58{\textendash}0.84) for regular walking
                  (typically >=2.5 h/week brisk walking) as compared
                  with almost no walking. The associations remained
                  significant after adjustment for BMI. Similar
                  associations were observed in men and women and in
                  the U.S. and Europe. CONCLUSIONS{\textemdash}These
                  findings indicate that adherence to recommendations
                  to participate in physical activities of moderate
                  intensity such as brisk walking can substantially
                  reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {Objective: To quantify the association between
                  walking and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
                  all cause mortality in healthy men and women. Data
                  sources: We searched Medline, Cochrane Database of
                  Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science databases
                  through May 2007. Study selection Prospective
                  epidemiological studies of walking and CVD and all
                  cause mortality. Results: We included eighteen
                  prospective studies in the overall analysis, which
                  incorporated 459,833 participants free from CVD at
                  baseline with 19,249 cases at follow up. From the
                  meta-analysis the pooled hazard ratio of CVD in the
                  highest walking category compared with the lowest
                  was 0.69, (95\% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.77, P
                  \&lt; 0.001), and 0.68 (0.59 to 0.78, P \&lt; 0.001)
                  for all cause mortality. These effects were robust
                  among men and women, although there was evidence of
                  publication biases for the associations with CVD
                  risk. Walking pace was a stronger independent
                  predictor of overall risk compared with walking
                  volume (48\% vs. 26\% risk reductions
                  respectively). There was also evidence of a dose
                  response relationship across the highest,
                  intermediate, and lowest walking categories in
                  relation to the outcome measures. Conclusions: Our
                  results suggest walking is inversely associated with
                  clinical disease endpoints and largely support the
                  current guidelines for physical activity. The
                  mechanisms that mediate this relationship remain
                  largely unknown and should be the focus of future
                  research.},
